# What?
HomeAssistant integration of a Texas Instruments HDC1080 Temperature/Humidity Evaluation Module (EVM).  
With a few modifications, may also work on similar devices from their [Sensing Solutions EVM range](https://www.ti.com/lit/zip/snoc028).  
 
# Why?
By design, the evaluation board works with the official software only.  
As such, no documentation regarding third-party integration is readily available - the information contained in this repo is obtained via reverse-engineering efforts.  
Once the minimal communication protocol (for sampling temperature/humidity) is known, the board can be connected locally to a HomeAssistant instance via it's USB port.  

# How?

## 1. Determine communication protocol
Once connected, the device enumerates as a USB CDC, i.e. a virtual COM (serial) port (with parameters 115200, 8N1) - driver installation may be required on Windows, while Linux has native support on modern kernels versions.  
Optionally, a firmware update may be required, as each compatible sensor requires a specific binary flash image:  
- Login/register onto [TI.com](www.ti.com), then download the **WINDOWS-ONLY** [Sensing Solutions EVM GUI](https://www.ti.com/lit/zip/snoc028) - it may be necessary to rename the downloaded file from `snoc028f` to `snoc028f.zip`,  
- After installation, run the software, and using the `Firmware` tab accesible from top-left menu, update to the appropiate firmware file, i.e. `C:\ti\Sensing Solutions EVM GUI-1.10.0\EVM Firmware\HDC10x0\HDC10x0_EVM_Firmware.txt`.  
The board waits for commands and responds on a fixed payload structure (the raw bytes are displayed as hex-coded, little-endian):  
- To read the value of a internal register, a command is formed as `HEADER[4] TYPE[2] ADDR[1] VALUE[2] CRC[1]`, with the response `HEADER[4] TYPE[2] ADDR[1] VALUE[2] CRC1[1] PAD[11] CRC2[1]`, where:  
	- [i] = i number of bytes,  
	- `HEADER` = always `0x4c330100`,  
	- `TYPE` = `0x340` for a register read command, `0x440` for a register read response,  
	- `ADDR` = address of the sensor's internal register - for HDC1080 most notable are:  
		- `0x00` holds the current temperature measurement raw value,  
		- `0x01` holds the humidity value  
	- `VALUE` = always `0x02` in a read register command, while in the response it contains the actual value stored in the requested register,  
	- `PAD` = padding, all null bytes (`0x00`) - a command contains no padding, while a response uses 11-bytes,  
	- `CRC`, `CRC1`, `CRC2` = CRC8 checksum of all the payload bytes - `CRC1` is equal to `CRC2`.
- To request the temperature value, send `0x4c3301000340000287` as raw binary, while for humidity send `0x4c3301000340010292`.  
The board will send after each request the measurement value, so only each command shall be sent only after a response was received.
- The raw values need to be converted to obtain the physical value:  
	- `temperature_value = round((register_value * 165) / 65536 - 40, 3)`,  
	- `humidity_value = round((register_value * 100) / 65536, 3)`.  
For example, a response payload of `0x4c33010004400062f8a60000000000000000000000a6` contains the temperature value of 23.788Â°C, while `0x4c3301000440019b8417000000000000000000000017` shows that humidity is at 60.748%.  

## 2. Configure the data relay
Since the Python script relies on non-standard libraries, a [Home Assistant Docker installation](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux#install-home-assistant-container) is assumed to be already working. Also, a MQTT broker (for example Mosquito) is also [installed](https://mosquitto.org/download), [configured](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-conf-5.html) and [accessible in HA](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/broker).  
As a alternative, a separate PC can also be used for interfacing to the HDC1080.  
- Install the required python libraries: `sudo pip install paho_mqtt crccheck pyserial`.  
- For local sampling, as a consequence of using a USB-to-serial adapter, at each device plug-in and system restart, the console name (`/dev/tty*`) could be reassigned a random name.  
	In Debian (Raspbian) add the following line in `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-com.rules`:  
	`SUBSYSTEM=='tty', ATTRS{idVendor}=='2047', ATTRS{idProduct}=='08f8', ATTRS{serial}=='0123456789ABCDEF', SYMLINK+='ttyCOM1'`, where:  
	- `0123456789ABCDEF` = the board's unique serial number, that can be obtained by running `lsusb -v` and scrolling to the device with attribute `idProduct`=`FDC2x14/LDC13xx/LDC16xx EVM`, and noting its `iSerial` attribute's value,  
	- `ttyCOM1` = the console name to be static assigned - to be entered in the parameter `LINUX_SERIAL_PORT` at the following step.  
- Edit the [`private_config.json`](scripts/private_config.json) file by configuring the:
	- used MQTT broker (`HOSTNAME`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`),  
	- used serial port `SERIAL_PORT` and sampling interval `SAMPLE_INTERVAL`.  
- Run the Python script: `python3 mqtt_hdc1080.py`  

## 3. Configure the HomeAssistant instance
User configuration is not necessary, as [MQTT auto-discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/) is implemented.
